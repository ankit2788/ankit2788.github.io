Hyperscalers have been all over the news recently. Even if you haven’t come across the term explicitly, you’ve almost certainly heard about _data centers, cloud computing, or AI infrastructure_—all of which sit at the core of what hyperscalers do. 

{% include admonition.html type="info" title="<b>Hyperscalers</b>" body="
Hyperscalers is a fancy name given to the massive cloud service providers which operate these heavy data centers, offering on-demand, highly scalable computing, storage, and networking resources to businesses globally."
%}

Since the launch of ChatGPT back in 2022, data centers have undergone a rapid evolution, driven by the unprecedented computational and power demands of generative AI workloads. This transformation involves __fundamental shifts in hardware, architecture, power consumption, and cooling methods__. 

Companies such as __Meta Platforms__ (_formerly Facebook_) have shifted strategy—from being primarily social media platforms, to experimenting with the metaverse, and now increasingly toward __AI-driven infrastructure at scale__. Several other large technology and software firms are following a similar path, leveraging their data, compute capabilities, and AI expertise.

This surge in data center development is no longer a localized phenomenon—it has triggered large-scale infrastructure build-outs across geographies. However, such expansion is highly capital intensive. Infrastructure at this scale is not free, and funding it requires careful timing and access to deep pockets.

In this article, I will focus on: <br>
(i) The scale of hyperscalers' expansion  <br>
(ii)  Why this investment cycle is accelerating now  <br>
(iii)  How recent debt issuance fits into the broader rate-cut environment<br>
(iv)  What investors are demanding in return<br>
(v)  And what this may signal for credit quality and the broader debt market<br>

## Hyperscalers' Scale and their expansion

Companies such as Meta Platforms, Microsoft etc. have diverged from their core businesses to AI Infrastructure as well. This is evident from the fact that number fo data centers they have been operating has been increasing year on year. Latest stats from [datacentermap](https://www.datacentermap.com/) as below:

Furthermore, most of the major players announced heavy fund raises this year in order to increase their capacity.

> Then there is [Project Stargate](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/), _a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States_.

This is just the highlight, and all of this happened just in 2025. You can imagine the scale by looking at the amount of capital deployment. Just how [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) expresses big numbers, its fascinating to imagine how huge $500 billion in. It is 500,000,000,000, that is 11 zeros after 5. 


Since OpenAI driven ChatGPT came into market, AI driven companies have skyrocketed. This was all led by the chipmaker NVIDIA. SInce then, other companies followed the suit. Since 2022, [NVIDIA's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/){:target="_blank"} price have risen by over 400%, whereas [ORCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL/){:target="_blank"}, [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/){:target="_blank"}, etc have nearly doubled.

## So, why is this expansion happening only now? In 2025? What are the key drivers?

ChatGPT came in 2022. NVDA started rising up in 2024. So, why only now there is a significant rise in fund raising? Did something change in the debt market or inverstors' appetite? 

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** has been there for quite sometime. Cloud providers have changed the global tech industry. With AI now entering, the new phase is about [AI-optimized IaaS](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-15-gartner-says-artificial-intelligence-optimized-iaas-is-poised-to-become-the-next-growth-engine-for-artificial-intelligence-infrastructure?utm_source=chatgpt.com){:target="_blank"}. And thats where the long term bet is. 

* **Rapid Enterprise adoption of AI** - From just being an experimental and proof-of-concept tool, AI has now become a full blown productivity and workload improvement assistance in large enterprises. That has led to a huge demand for more compute power and scalability. 

* **Financing Conditions and Capital markets** - Recent rate cuts have made it quite cheaper to raise funds in the debt market. 2025 itself saw a record boom in debt issuance by tech companies. Some estimates mark it above $120 billion. 

* **Competitive edge** - Big names means desire to retain the competitive edge. They are expanding rapidly to be the very few providers of hyperscalers in the future. Thats why this year saw all big names raising double digit billions of dollars in debt markets.


In this article, we will primarily focus on the **Financing conditions** and how they favoured the fund raising this year.
Let's look at the recent debt issuances by these hyperscalers

{% include /casestudiesHTML/hyperscalers/issuanceTable.html %}

### What's in for investors?

Over $80 billion in new issuances by these hyperscalers, and that's just in the last quarter. __Why so?__ _Are the rates attractive for investors?_ 

Rate cuts have happened for sure. But is the new rate still in demand by the investors? 
A lower rate regime is a promising market to raise new capital for the issuer. Imagine paying 1% less annually on a $30 Billion issuance. That translates to nearly $300 Million of less annual payout. What's in it for the end investor?

       alt="Rate cuts US">
</div>

* __Positive real yields__ - 
In **real yield** terms (after taking into account for long term inflation, which is floating around 2%), Investors are still getting 4-5% yield on longer duration bonds. Compare that with 2020/ 2021 period when long term yields were of the order of 2%, turning real yield _negative_. 

* __Credit spreads havent vanished__ - 
These hyperscalers come under the so-called category of Investment grade (IG) issuances, These are quality issuers, with extremely less probability of defaults. So, investors  are locking in IG grade debt with positive real yields. 

* __Curve Steepening__ - 
This is quite interesting. Over the last 1 year or so, there is a significant steepening of the yield curve on the longer end. That means, there is now a premium associated with a longer term debt favouring the investors.

### Dance of the US Yield Curve

Back in 2019, I published an article on [Dance of India Yield curve](https://ankit2788.github.io/finance/2019-03-19-The-India-Yield-Curve-Musical/){:target="_blank"}. It garnered quite a traction on how yield curve changed during the years in Indian context. 

On the similar grounds, here is the "soundless" musical on [__US Yield Curve dance__](/data/pics/casestudies/hyperscalers/YieldCurveDance.gif){:target="_blank"}

## Impact on the broader Debt market?

Significantly large and long-dated issuances may have a broader impact on the debt market overall.
These are some of the potential impacts these issuances may have. Ofcourse, these are personal opinions and reality may hit harder or softer as time progresses. 

* __Quasi-sovereign duration suppliers__ - 
Why Quasi sovereign? These hyperscalers are playing a role of a "state" or a "sovereign" entity because of their extremely critical global infrastructure provision of "_Geopolitical significance_" .  Besides, issuing a longer duration bond, they are injecting a lot of duration into the market. Good for "_duration hunters_". 

* __Crowding-in effect__ - 
Earlier, such longer dated bonds were primarily by the sovereigns. With Corporates (or hyperscalers) entering the field, it may reduce the demand for long-dated sovereigns. Furthermore, spreads may reduce for high quality issuers. 

* __Benchmarking across IG credit__ - 
Once top tier issuers print ultra long bonds, other IG issuers may start benchmarking off them

* __Interaction with monetary policy__ - 
In case of further rate cuts, _which will drive the shorter end of the yield curve_, the longer end may end sticky due to increased supply and term premium normalization. 

* __Quasi-infrastructure credit__ - 
Markets may re-classify hyperscalers as "utility-like characteristics". This may have a broader impact on the benchmarking of Utilities, REITs etc.

* __Capital expenditure signaling & credit expectations__ - 
Large & longer dated issuances indicate confidence in long term growth.
