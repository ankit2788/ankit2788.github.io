> _Time flies, or I have been told! Another year gone. 1 more year older. Does that mean more wiser?_


2025 certainly tried to answer that question. The year unfolded amid __geopolitical tensions, tariff skirmishes, physical wars, AI wars, and unprecedented fundraising across asset classes__. Compressing all of this into a single page would do injustice to the complexity.

Instead, this note offers a high-level, __month-by-month recap__ of Indian markets—how they reacted, and what ultimately mattered.

#### 2025 in isolation

- Most strategy and thematic indices ended 2025 in negative territory, despite the Nifty 50 itself delivering ~10%. 
- Momentum, Alpha, Media, and Railways were among the weakest performers, extending a broader pattern of mean reversion after strong post-COVID years.
- Even traditionally defensive strategies such as Low Volatility failed to outperform meaningfully, highlighting the absence of a clean “risk-off” year.

#### Post-2020 distortion and normalization

- The 2020–2021 columns stand out as structural outliers, with unusually broad-based and elevated returns across strategies.
- The subsequent years (2022–2025) reflect a normalization phase, with _Lower average returns_


#### Sectoral, Strategies and Themes post 2020: 

- __Defence, Auto and Railways__ demonstrate extreme volatility, with multi-year streaks of strong gains (since 2020) - classic expressions of policy, capex expansions. 2025 not a good year for Railways, even after December rally.
- 2020 onwards, __Low Vol__ has been consistent and market darling, whereas __High beta and Momentum__ exhibited extreme volatility.
- Surprisingly, __Equal weighted Nifty__ outperformed market weighted Nifty 50. Not so surprisingly, __Nifty USD__ underperformed consistently highlighting significant INR depcrecation over the years.

## Conclusion


2025 was a tale of two halves:
- Feb capitulation → Mar–Oct recovery → Nov–Dec consolidation
- Small and MidCaps delivered high volatility, not free alpha — liquidity mattered more than growth.

Large caps benefited from earnings certainty and balance sheet strength. Domestic liquidity was the key stabilizer, offsetting intermittent FII outflows.

> _Overall, If markets grow wiser with time, 2025 was a lesson in humility—where patience mattered more than prediction, and resilience mattered more than momentum._
