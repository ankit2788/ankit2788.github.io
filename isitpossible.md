Has the number of superheroes in Marvel comics got to do something with the commercial plane flying licenses given in the United States? Or is there a relation between number of deaths and number of births?

Inspired from [Tyler Vigen's website](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), the information here will leave you thinking '_Could that be possible?_'


### Superheroes Vs Aliens!

There have been quite a number of [Superhero movies released](https://flightstightsandmovienights.com/review-index/the-list/#2000) in the past decade. Be it Marvel or DC Comics, every other movie eventually play against the far reachable enemy: 'ALIENS'.

During this time frame, however, number of [UFO sightings](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) around the world has increased as well. Apparently this correlates very well with number of movie releases.

Is there a connection somewhere? Could that be possible?

### Rebirth from India to Switzerland!

Birth and Death are inevitable. Every year, [thousands of people die in road accidents](https://data.gov.in/resources/total-number-persons-killed-road-accidents-india-during-2003-2014/download) in India. Far away in a distant land, _Switzerland_, [thousands of babies are being born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Switzerland) every year.

Coincidentally, these numbers are telling us a story. The story behind never ending topic of rebirth? Rebirth, Or Reincarnation? Could that be possible?

### Hollywood promoting education in India!

A money making industry as Hollywood must be doing something right (socially) that it has its '_fans_' around the world. [Hundreds of movies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187147/movie-releases-in-north-america-since-1980/) every year, so where are the profits going?

Take India for instance. With a population of 1.3 billion (_and constantly on the rise_), it needs monies to sustain the education of its young brigade. [Number of universities](http://mhrd.gov.in/statist) has been on the rise. Higher education isn't a myth anymore in India!

Is Hollywood behind India's higher literacy rate? Could that be possible?
