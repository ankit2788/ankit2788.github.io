  Chaos is considered to be without a pattern. That's why its chaos. But is it really true?
  <br>
  Can we find a patern within chaos?
  <br>
  <br>
  Nature has a lot of chaotic and complex structures. A mountain, a coastline, a leaf or even planetary bodies; these are are extremely chaotic to think about. 
  Fractals help to find a pattern in this chaos. Nature doesn't follow a fractal behaviour; however a fractal model best explains the structure of such a complex pattern. [**Fractal theory**](https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-is-chaos-theory/){:target="_blank"} has found its application in every aspect of technology, be it *Computer graphics*, *Communications*, *Modeling landscapes*, as well as *Finance*.

  <br>
  First developed and used by [*Benoit Mandelbrot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot){:target="_blank"}, he devoted his entire life on understanding the simplicity as well as complexity of Fractals.

  This series is not to go into the mathematics of how fractals are modeled but at a more fundamental level - What are Fractals, and what kind of a power they possess?
